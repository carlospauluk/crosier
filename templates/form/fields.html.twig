{#
   Each field type is rendered by a template fragment, which is determined
   by the name of your form type class (DateTimePickerType -> date_time_picker)
   and the suffix "_widget". This can be controlled by overriding getBlockPrefix()
   in DateTimePickerType.

   See https://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/create_custom_field_type.html#creating-a-template-for-the-field

{{ bla1 }}
<select {{ block('widget_attributes') }} class="form-control">
